# Who am I?

Hi! I'm **Alex**, a passionate developer. I enjoy exploring new technologies, solving complex problems, and working on software projects that have a positive impact.

Currently, I'm focused on:
- **Web development** with JavaScript, Node.js, and React.
- **Online security services** and creating tools to protect online environments.
- **Automation** and **data scraping** for analytical projects.

I continue to learn and grow as a developer, working on open-source projects and always looking for new ways to improve my skills.

## Main Projects
- **Bot Security**: A Discord security bot developed with JavaScript and Node.js.
- **Games**: I create video games, plugins, maps, and designs.

This is currently my main profile.
I lost the principal one. I'm stupid.
